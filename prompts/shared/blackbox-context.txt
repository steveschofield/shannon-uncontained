# Black-Box Mode Agent Guidelines
=== BLACKBOX CONTEXT ===

<critical>
**SYNTHETIC SOURCE WARNING:**
The source code you are analyzing was GENERATED by the Local Source Generator (LSG).
This is NOT the actual application source code — it is a synthetic reconstruction based on:
- External network reconnaissance (nmap, subfinder, whatweb)
- Active crawling and endpoint discovery
- JavaScript analysis and API schema detection
- Heuristic inference of routes, models, and parameters

**CRITICAL LIMITATIONS:**
1. Route implementations are INFERRED, not actual code
2. Model schemas are BEST GUESSES based on form analysis
3. Database queries shown are HYPOTHETICAL
4. Authentication flows are approximations
5. Business logic is UNKNOWN — treat as black box
</critical>

<adaptation_strategy>
**How to work with synthetic sources:**

1. **Trust the structure, question the details:**
   - File organization reflects discovered endpoints
   - Parameter names are from real requests
   - Implementation details are fabricated

2. **Focus on observable behavior:**
   - Test based on what endpoints DO, not what code SAYS
   - Use reconnaissance data as ground truth
   - Validate assumptions through actual testing

3. **Exploit candidate identification:**
   - Parameter types were INFERRED — test thoroughly
   - SQL injection candidates are based on naming heuristics
   - XSS candidates from content-type analysis
   - SSRF candidates from URL-like parameters

4. **Authentication handling:**
   - Auth flows are discovered through form analysis
   - Session mechanisms observed, not source-verified
   - Always verify with actual login attempts
</adaptation_strategy>

<metadata_markers>
**Look for these metadata markers in synthetic files:**

```javascript
// [LSG-SYNTHETIC] This file was generated by Local Source Generator
// [LSG-INFERRED] Route inferred from crawled endpoint
// [LSG-ESTIMATED] Parameter types estimated, not confirmed
// [LSG-WARNING] Security-relevant code is hypothetical
```

Files containing these markers require BLACK-BOX TESTING APPROACH:
- Do not trust internal logic
- Test actual HTTP behavior
- Use tools like `run_command` with curl/httpie
- Verify with Playwright for dynamic testing
</metadata_markers>

<workflow_adjustment>
**Modified workflow for black-box mode:**

1. **Skip deep code analysis** — Code is synthetic
2. **Prioritize endpoint testing** — Real data from recon
3. **Use HTTP tools directly** — curl, httpie, playwright
4. **Document observations** — Report actual vs expected behavior
5. **Lower confidence on code-based findings** — Require actual exploitation
</workflow_adjustment>

<priority_endpoints>
**High-priority targets in black-box mode:**

From reconnaissance, focus testing on:
- API endpoints with parameters (SQLi, IDOR)
- Form submission endpoints (XSS, Auth bypass)
- File upload/download (LFI, upload bypass)
- Redirect/callback parameters (SSRF, Open Redirect)
- Admin/privileged paths (AuthZ bypass)
</priority_endpoints>
