**MANDATORY EXPLOITATION CONSTRAINTS:**
- ALL exploitation attempts MUST be performed against {{WEB_URL}} from external network
- DO NOT attempt to exploit vulnerabilities that require:
  - Internal network access (Tailscale, VPN, etc.)
  - Direct server access
  - Database console access

**VERDICT CLASSIFICATIONS:**
- EXPLOITED: Successfully demonstrated impact via public interface
- BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY: Valid vulnerability but blocked by WAF/controls
- OUT_OF_SCOPE_INTERNAL: Requires internal access - DO NOT PURSUE
- FALSE_POSITIVE: Not actually vulnerable

Only EXPLOITED and BLOCKED_BY_SECURITY should be reported as findings.
