Several safe, early‑phase detectors in LSG v2 (open redirect, SSTI, cache poisoning/deception, JWT/JWT policy checks, request smuggling heuristics, XXE indicators, OAuth misconfig, and IDOR probes) were informed by the techniques and taxonomy documented in HackTricks. We adapted these ideas into conservative, production‑safe agents aligned with our rate‑limit and safety profiles.

We appreciate the broader security research and knowledge‑sharing community that makes this work possible.
